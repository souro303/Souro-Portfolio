            <h4>Hello, I'm <b>Souro!</b></h4>
            <p>
              I have a passion for coding, conducting research, and engaging in
              collaborative projects.

            <hr class="hover-hr" />
            <p>
              Starting with a foundation in C programming, I honed my
              problem-solving skills on platforms like Breecrowd. Transitioning
              to C++, I expanded my understanding of object-oriented programming
              principles and gained proficiency in a wider range of
              applications. Finally, dedicating myself to Python, I delved into
              its versatile capabilities, leveraging its simplicity and
              readability for various projects and collaborations. Through this
              journey, I've cultivated a diverse skill set and a deep
              appreciation for the power of programming languages in solving
              real-world challenges.
            </p>
            <p>
              Before I realized it, we seamlessly shifted from the previous
              system to mine. Suddenly, I found myself at the helm, responsible
              for hosting hundreds of thousands of laboratory samples and
              providing support to thousands of clients.
            </p>
            <p>
              From this you’ll see that I’m someone that jumps before I can talk
              myself out of doing something scary.

            <p>
              I can learn just about anything by having a final product to tear
              apart piece by piece. I break the code where I need to figure out
              why things work the way they do. Documentation is just a
              reference.
